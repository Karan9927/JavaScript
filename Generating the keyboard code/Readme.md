## Hosted Link
[Link for Generating the keyboard code](https://karan9927.github.io/JavaScript/Generating%20the%20keyboard%20code/)

This is a simple HTML webpage that allows users to interact with a vintage keycode keyboard. It provides visual and audio feedback when specific keys are pressed.

## HTML Tags Used

### `<html>`
The root element that encapsulates the entire HTML document.

### `<head>`
Contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the title and linked stylesheets.

### `<title>`
Specifies the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

### `<link>`
Associates an external stylesheet (style.css) with the HTML document for styling.

### `<body>`
Contains the content of the webpage that is visible to users.

### `<div>`
A generic container used to group and style elements.

### `<h2>`
Defines a second-level heading with the class "special," which is used to display special key combinations.

### `<audio>`
Used to embed audio elements on the page, each with different sound effects (audio1.mp3, audio2.mp3, audio3.mp3).

### `<source>`
Specifies the audio file source and its type within the `<audio>` element.

### `<script>`
References an external JavaScript file (script.js) that provides interactivity to the webpage.

## JavaScript Code Usage

The JavaScript code (in `script.js`) performs the following functions:

1. It selects various HTML elements using `document.getElementById()` and assigns them to JavaScript variables for manipulation.

2. It adds an event listener to the `document` that listens for the "keydown" event, which is triggered when a keyboard key is pressed.

3. When a key is pressed, it updates the content of the "keyboardDisplay" div to show the pressed key and its key code.

4. It checks if specific key combinations are pressed (e.g., Ctrl+Z, Alt+X, Ctrl+C) and plays corresponding audio effects using the `<audio>` elements.

5. It maintains a history of pressed keys in the `keyHistory` array and logs it to the console.

6. (Note: The line to display the key history is currently commented out in the code, but you can uncomment it to display the key history in the "keyHistory" div.)
