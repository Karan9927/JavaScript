## Functions in `script.js`

The JavaScript code in `script.js` defines and uses the following functions:

- `removeActive()`: A function that removes the 'active' class from rating divs.
- Event listeners for rating selection: JavaScript code that listens for clicks on rating divs and marks one as 'active' based on the user's selection.
- Event listener for the "Send Review" button: JavaScript code that displays user feedback if a rating is selected and shows an error message if not.

These functions and event listeners are used to create a basic feedback UI that allows users to provide feedback based on their sentiment.
